# House-price-prediction
> You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a Ridge and Lasso regression models for the prediction of house prices based on available independent variables.
- For this project, we are using the data provided - [data set](train.csv).

## Conclusions
- We built both the models one using Ridge regression and other using Lasso regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9.13
- Numpy - version 1.21.5
- Pandas - version 1.4.4
- Matplotlib - version 3.5.2
- Seaborn - version 0.11.2
- sklearn - version 1.0.2
- statsmodels - version 0.13.2
